You are helping me evaluate a response I wrote to someone else's post. I value your honest assessment.

Their Post:
{{post_text}}

My Response:
{{comment_text}}

Task:
Evaluate how well I responded to their post. As my AI assistant, please assess whether my response is helpful and appropriate.

Consider: Does my response treat their ideas fairly and contribute constructively to the discussion they started?

Rubric (0â€“5 each integer):
helpfulness: Adds insight, advances discussion (0 none, 5 strong actionable substance)
civility: Polite, respectful (0 overtly rude, 5 fully respectful)
specificity: Concrete references to parts of the post (0 generic, 5 highly specific)
stance_alignment: Perceived agreement level (0 fully opposes, 5 strongly agrees) (descriptive only)

Output JSON ONLY:
{
 "helpfulness": int,
 "civility": int,
 "specificity": int,
 "stance_alignment": int,
 "rationale": "one short sentence"
}
